# Work Experience 

## Risk Quant 
*  I worked on developing models to quantify risk and vulnerabilities associated with banking book.
*  Validation and data quality assessment for portfolio stress testing.

## Postdoctoral fellow  (Southern Methodist University /CERN )
During this postdoc tenure, I was associate member of European particle physics lab (CERN) as part of the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern.ch). 

## Postdoctoral fellow (UT Austin/ CERN) 
During this postdoct tenure, I was asociate member of European particle physics lab (CERN) as part of the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern.ch)

## Guest Scientist 
* Performed simulations and designed a high rate (10^9 decays /second) muon decay experiment.
Muons are heavier cousins of electrons. They are very unstable particles and they decay within a couple of micro seconds.  Some of the deep mysteries of the structure of matter in our universe can potentiall unlocked by collecting a large amount of muon decay data.  The [Mu3e](https://www.psi.ch/en/mu3e) experiment is currently under construction at Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.
